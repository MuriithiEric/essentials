    <h1>Welcome to My House</h1>
    <p>In this simple document, I will describe to you my house</p>
    <p>
      One thing about my house is it's very big and has got all the amenities
      you could think of. It's got a  <a href="garden.html">garden room</a> a 
      <a href="kitchen.html">kitchen</a> and lat but not least, a <a href="drawing.html">drawing room.</a>
      which I think is pretty cool!
